### What I learned

To be honest, i have only completed project with the help of a tutorial or i just inspect the page itself. This would be my first ever project that i attempted on my own with a few suggestions from CHATGPT on styling. the first thing I did was to create a github repository for the project and hosted it on netlify. I was rather overwhelmed and didn't know where to begin. I just calmed myself down and started with structuring the page. I went in with styling. This is mostly where i struggled because I wasn't really familiar with a lot of CSS properties so I did my research for any style i couldn't quite remember or know.


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of would be</h1>


```
```css
.section-container{
    text-align: center;
    font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
    width: 340px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    padding-top: 15px;
    padding-bottom: 15px;
    border-radius: 15px;
    box-shadow: 10px 15px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);

}
```



### Continued development

This project has really shown me where I need to focus in future work, especially when it comes to CSS styling and mobile responsiveness. I've learned how important it is to make designs clean and adaptable to different screen sizes. Moving forward, I’m excited to sharpen my skills in these areas to create better, more user-friendly web projects.
