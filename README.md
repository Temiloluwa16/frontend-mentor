### What I learned

To be honest, most of my previous projects were done by following tutorials or inspecting other pages. This project is the first one I’ve attempted on my own, with a few styling suggestions from ChatGPT. The first step I took was creating a GitHub repository and hosting the project on Netlify. At first, I felt pretty overwhelmed and wasn’t sure where to start, but I calmed myself down and began by structuring the page.

Styling was where I struggled the most since I wasn’t familiar with a lot of CSS properties. I ended up doing a lot of research for styles I couldn’t remember or didn’t know. But in the end, I’m proud of pushing through and figuring things out along the way


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of would be</h1>


```
```css
.section-container{
    text-align: center;
    font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
    width: 340px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    padding-top: 15px;
    padding-bottom: 15px;
    border-radius: 15px;
    box-shadow: 10px 15px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);

}
```



### Continued development

This project has really shown me where I need to focus in future work, especially when it comes to CSS styling and mobile responsiveness. I've learned how important it is to make designs clean and adaptable to different screen sizes. Moving forward, I’m excited to sharpen my skills in these areas to create better, more user-friendly web projects.
